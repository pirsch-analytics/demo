# Pirsch Analytics JS SDK Demo

This demo shows how you can use the Pirsch JavaScript/TypeScript SDK in the browser.

## Configuration

Adjust the `identificationCode` in `main.ts`. You will also need a dashboard on Pirsch with `localhost.com` as the domain and be able to access the demo locally on `localhost.com:8079` (for example by adding it to `/etc/hosts`).

## Usage

Install the SDK using `npm i` and run the demo using `npm run demo`. Open the URL that is displayed in your terminal in your browser to view the demo.
